Community Vault holds airdrops of Launched projects ... can divest over AngelSwap... or redeem and divest upon uniswap listing 

Community help to to grow and support their investments before opening of liquidity pools on UNI.

$Angel is a social engagement and airdrop currency pairing both investors and entrepreneurs looking to raise capital ... a community driven "dragons den" 
 
There will only ever be a maximum of 10 million $Angels ever created, with the value of each $Angel being underpinned by a basket of community certified launches held in the community Vault(s)
 
Another dimension to the $Angel's value is the access granted to Defi Prophets Incubator and community investment capital and the growth of $Angel as a brand.

Staked $Angel Tokens give communtiy members access to voting and community discussion groups and facilitate the issuance of other NFT and independant community pools. Of which launches over  Angel swap feed back to all staked $Angel holders
