$Angel is a social currency that is backed by community supported launches from Benâ€™s trusted and fair project launcher model, embodying fair and distributed cap tables for the projects our community love.
 
There will only ever be a maximum of 10 million $Angels ever created, with the launch value of each $Angel being underpinned by a basket of some of the rarest and sought after initial dex offering tokens  in the industry ("The Vault").
 
The Vault is only one dimension that defines the value of $Angel as a Social Currency. More important to the project is the growth of the community, the growth of $Angel as a brand, and the growth of use cases for $Angel as a Social Currency.
i dont want to call it an ETF
